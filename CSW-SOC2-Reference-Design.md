# Cisco Secure Workload — SOC 2 Compliance Framework
## Reference Design | Enterprise Accounts

**Version:** 1.0 | **Standard:** SOC 2 Type II (AICPA Trust Services Criteria)

---

> **Coverage legend** — this reference design and its compliance report use three words:
> - 🟢 **Direct** — CSW produces the primary evidence artifact.
> - 🟠 **Supporting** — CSW produces an input that feeds or complements another control.
> - ⚪ **Evidence Required** *(supplied outside CSW)* — CSW produces nothing here; the item is in scope for compliance but out of scope for CSW, so the customer evidences it via another control, tool, or process. A scope boundary, not a gap or "unsupported."

## Reader's Guide

**Who this is for.** Service organizations preparing for or maintaining
an annual SOC 2 Type II attestation, and the security or GRC teams who
own the report.

**Questions this reference design helps you answer:**

- *Which Common Criteria controls can I evidence with continuous data
  rather than point-in-time samples? Type II auditors increasingly
  prefer the former.* (CC6.1, CC6.6, CC7.2)
- *When my auditor asks me to prove a segmentation control "operated
  effectively throughout the period", what does the artifact look
  like?* (CC6.1, CC6.6)
- *When a customer in due diligence asks "is workload X isolated from
  workload Y?", can I prove it from live data instead of a network
  diagram?* (CC6.1, CC6.7)
- *Are my privileged access changes producing the artifact format my
  auditor's evidence template expects?* (CC6.2, CC6.3)
- *For my Availability or Confidentiality TSC additions, what do I gain
  from workload-level telemetry that I don't get today?*

**What you'll need.** A defined trust boundary (system description),
your current TSC selection, and your auditor's evidence request list
or last year's PBC list.

**Where to start.** Section 1 for the TSC↔CSW capability map; sections
2–3 to design evidence collection; sections 4–5 if you're inside the
audit window.

## CSW primer — if you are new to Cisco Secure Workload

Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) is a **workload protection platform**. A lightweight **agent** on each server/VM/container observes processes and network flows; **cloud connectors** add AWS/Azure/GCP inventory where agents are not deployed.

| CSW term | Meaning | Why compliance teams care |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **Scope** | Logical boundary (CDE, PHI zone, CUI enclave) | Defines the systems you must prove are isolated |
| **Label / filter** | Tag or query assigning workloads to scopes | Automates scope membership — reduces drift |
| **ADM** | Application Dependency Mapping from observed traffic | **Live** network/data-flow diagram for assessors |
| **Workspace** | Policy container for one scope or application | Where allow/deny rules are authored |
| **Monitor → Simulation → Enforce** | Safe rollout sequence | Simulation = change-board evidence before blocking traffic |
| **Denied Connections** | Log of flows blocked by policy | Primary proof that enforcement **operates** |

**Console areas:** Investigate (inventory, flows, vulns) · Defend/Segmentation (policy) · Manage (agents) · Platform (connectors) · Administration (audit log)

## Universal evidence workflow

Execute these phases for **this framework's** compliance boundary. Map exports to control IDs in the **Reporting & Evidence** section below.

| Phase | Goal | Key CSW actions | Typical duration |
|-------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| **1 — Coverage** | Every in-scope workload in CSW | Install agents/connectors; apply compliance labels; create scope | Days 1–10 |
| **2 — Baseline** | Machine-generated flow map | Run ADM ≥2 weeks; export clusters; app-owner signoff | Days 11–28 |
| **3 — Policy** | Designed isolation before enforce | Build workspace; Simulation mode; fix false positives | Days 29–45 |
| **4 — Operate** | Continuous proof between audits | Enforce; quarterly export pack; ADM refresh every 90 days | Ongoing |

### Phase 1 checklist (coverage)

- [ ] In-scope host list reconciled to CSW Inventory (100% or documented exceptions)
- [ ] Labels applied: `compliance:<framework>`, `data:<classification>`, `env:<tier>`
- [ ] CSW scope created matching compliance boundary
- [ ] **Export:** inventory CSV + agent status screenshot

### Phase 2 checklist (baseline)

- [ ] ADM running on compliance scope for full business cycle (≥2 weeks)
- [ ] Unexpected flows documented (shadow IT, vendor egress, scope creep)
- [ ] App owners signed cluster-to-application mapping
- [ ] **Export:** ADM diagram + flow samples with process context

### Phase 3 checklist (policy)

- [ ] Default-deny posture defined for sensitive scope
- [ ] ADM-imported rules refined; Simulation run ≥1 week
- [ ] Change tickets for false-positive fixes; exception register updated
- [ ] **Export:** policy export + simulation report

### Phase 4 checklist (operate)

- [ ] Enforcement enabled on pilot scope; negative test recorded in Denied Connections
- [ ] Quarterly pack: inventory, policy, denies, vulns, audit log (see playbook)
- [ ] SIEM integration verified (sample events)
- [ ] **Export:** enforcement screenshot + quarterly binder

### What CSW evidence does not replace

Physical access, HR/training records, encryption key management, signed BAAs/vendor contracts, formal pen tests, and assessor attestation still require separate programmes. CSW addresses the **workload-resident** slice: segmentation, flows, process context, vuln reachability, and change drift.

---

## CSW effectiveness for this framework

- CC6/CC7: continuous control operation vs. auditor sample windows
- Change and drift evidence from policy audit log + ADM refresh
- Customer due-diligence pack from repeatable quarterly exports

**Compared to manual programmes:** static diagrams and annual firewall samples age immediately; CSW ties evidence to **live workload behaviour** and produces queryable exports on demand — supporting "operating effectively" language in PCI v4.0, SOC 2 CC7, and HIPAA risk analysis.

## 1. Overview

SOC 2 Type II audits evaluate whether security controls operated effectively over a defined period (typically 6–12 months). Cisco Secure Workload (CSW) can support evidence for selected **Security** Trust Services Criteria (TSC) and contribute technical inputs to **Availability**, **Confidentiality**, and **Processing Integrity** criteria through workload visibility, micro-segmentation, vulnerability exposure context, and forensic telemetry.

### SOC 2 TSC to CSW Capability Map

| Trust Services Criteria | CSW Capability |
|---|---|
| CC6 — Logical & Physical Access | Micro-segmentation, scope-based access enforcement |
| CC7 — System Operations | Anomaly detection, vulnerability exposure visibility, alerting |
| CC8 — Change Management | Policy workspace versioning, ADM drift detection |
| CC9 — Risk Mitigation | Vulnerability prioritization, compensating controls |
| A1 — Availability | Workload health monitoring, sensor telemetry |
| C1 — Confidentiality | PHI/PII zone isolation, encryption enforcement |

## 2. SOC 2 Audit Preparation with CSW

### 2.1 Evidence Collection Timeline

SOC 2 Type II requires evidence across the **entire audit period**. Configure CSW from Day 1:

- Enable full flow telemetry retention (minimum 12 months)
- Enable policy workspace audit logging
- Schedule monthly vulnerability scan exports
- Configure alert export to SIEM for centralized evidence collection

### 2.2 Key Control Areas

**CC6.1 — Logical Access Controls**
- CSW enforces workload-level allowlist policies
- Every inbound connection to sensitive workloads requires explicit policy approval
- Policy violations logged with source, destination, process, and timestamp

**CC6.6 — Network and Infrastructure Controls**
- ADM documents communication paths visible to CSW over the selected observation window; corroborate coverage gaps with other discovery sources
- Micro-segmentation enforces least-privilege network access
- External access paths (third-party, partner) isolated in dedicated CSW scopes

**CC6.7 — Transmission of Confidential Information**
- CSW detects unencrypted transmission (HTTP, FTP, plain LDAP)
- Alerts trigger on any plaintext flow from confidential data scopes
- Encryption compliance report available for auditor evidence package

**CC7.1 — Detection of Vulnerabilities**
- Continuous vulnerability exposure / CVE inventory for CSW-instrumented workloads
- CVSS-scored reports with workload-level attribution
- Remediation tracking via policy compensating controls

**CC7.2 — Monitoring of System Components**
- Full process and network telemetry across all monitored workloads
- Anomaly detection alerts on baseline deviation
- Sensor health monitoring — alerts on agent offline events

**CC7.3 — Evaluation of Security Events**
- Forensic telemetry supports security event investigation
- Process-level audit trail: what ran, when, what it connected to
- Flow search enables retrospective query across audit period

## 3. CSW Deployment for SOC 2

### 3.1 Scope Definition

Define CSW scopes aligned to SOC 2 system boundaries:

```
Root Scope
└── SOC2-Boundary (audit scope)
    ├── Production-Systems (primary controls)
    │   ├── Application-Servers
    │   ├── Databases
    │   └── APIs
    ├── Supporting-Infrastructure
    │   ├── Auth-Systems (LDAP/SSO)
    │   └── Monitoring-Stack
    └── Third-Party-Integrations
        └── Vendor-Connections
```

### 3.2 Policy Requirements per CC Control

| CC Control | CSW Policy Requirement |
|---|---|
| CC6.1 | Default-deny inbound to Production-Systems scope |
| CC6.6 | Explicit allowlist for all inter-service communication |
| CC6.7 | Block HTTP/FTP from Production-Systems; enforce HTTPS |
| CC7.1 | Vulnerability scan enabled on all SOC2-Boundary workloads |
| CC7.2 | Anomaly detection alert on all Production-Systems |
| CC8.1 | Policy changes require approval workflow; audit logged |

### 3.3 Continuous Monitoring Setup

```
CSW UI → Defend → Alerts
  → New Alert Policy
  → Scope: SOC2-Boundary
  → Triggers:
    - Policy violation (any)
    - New vulnerability CVSS ≥ 7.0
    - Sensor offline > 5 minutes
    - Anomalous flow (ADM baseline deviation)
  → Notify: SIEM webhook + email to security team
```

| Evidence Item | CSW Source | CC Control | Frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| Access control policy export | Defend → Policy Workspaces | CC6.1 | Per audit request |
| Policy violation log | Alerts → Triggered Events | CC6.1, CC6.6 | Monthly export |
| Vulnerability exposure report | Investigate → Vulnerability | CC7.1, CC9.1 | Weekly |
| Network flow audit log | Investigate → Flow Search | CC6.7, CC7.2 | Continuous |
| Anomaly alert log | Alerts → Dashboard | CC7.2, CC7.3 | Monthly |

| Sensor health report | Manage → Agents | CC7.2, A1.1 | Monthly |
| Policy change audit trail | Policy workspace history | CC8.1 | Per change |

---

## 5. Common SOC 2 Audit Findings CSW Addresses

| Auditor Finding | CSW Remediation |
|---|---|
| Undocumented network access paths | ADM generates observed dependency maps as evidence inputs |
| No workload-level access controls | Micro-segmentation enforces and logs all access |
| Undetected lateral movement | Anomaly detection + forensic telemetry |
| No evidence of encryption enforcement | Protocol-level flow analysis + block policy |
| Vulnerability management gaps | Continuous vulnerability exposure view with CVSS prioritization |
| Insufficient logging | Full process + network telemetry across audit period |
